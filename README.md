# Obilet Clone – SwiftUI

Previously, I created a **BlaBlaCar clone**, and in this project, I focused on **Obilet**, a widely used ticket booking app in Turkey.  
The main goal of this project is to **replicate and design Obilet’s screens, layouts, and user interface** using SwiftUI to practice UI/UX skills.

All data is **local**, and no backend functionality is implemented. This project **does not include real ticket booking, payment processing, or live API integration**. It is purely for UI/UX design and development practice.

> ⚠️ Note: Since the main purpose of this project is to **design screens**, localization and multi-language support (`Localizable`) were not included.
